        <h1>Project Background</h1>
        <p>Nowadays, marketing expenditures in the banking industry are massive, meaning that it is essential for banks to optimize marketing strategies and improve effectiveness. Understanding customers’ need leads to more effective marketing plans, smarter product designs and greater customer satisfaction.</p>

        <p><strong>Main Objectives: predict customers' responses to future marketing campaigns & increase the effectiveness of the bank's telemarketing campaign</strong></p>

        <p>This project will enable the bank to develop a more granular understanding of its customer base, predict customers' response to its telemarketing campaign and establish a target customer profile for future marketing plans.</p>

        <p>By analyzing customer features, such as demographics and transaction history, the bank will be able to predict customer saving behaviors and identify which type of customers is more likely to make term deposits. The bank can then focus its marketing efforts on those customers. This will not only allow the bank to secure deposits more effectively but also increase customer satisfaction by reducing undesirable advertisements for certain customers.</p><br>


        <h1>About the Data</h1>
        <p>The dataset is about the direct phone call marketing campaigns, which aim to promote term deposits among existing customers, by a Portuguese banking institution from May 2008 to November 2010. It is publicly available in the <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing#">UCI Machine Learning Repository.</a></p>

        <p>There are 41,188 observations in the dataset, with no missing values. Each represents an existing customer that the bank reached via phone calls.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>For each observation, the dataset records <strong>16 input variables</strong> that stand for both qualitative and quantitative attributes of the customer, such as age, job, housing and personal loan status, account balance, and the number of contacts. </li>
          <li>There is <strong>a single binary output variable</strong> that denotes “yes” or “no” revealing the outcomes of the marketing phone calls. "Yes" means that a customer subscribed to term deposits. </li>
        </ul><br>
        

        <h3>Data Cleaning</h3>
        <p>Several changes were made to the dataset to prepare it for analysis.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>Drop ambiguous values, such as "others" and "unknown".</p></li>

          <li>
            <p>Drop outliers to capture the general trend. Outliers are defined as customers whose balance levels are either too high or too low (i.e., more than three standard deviations away from the mean).</p></li>

          <li>
            <p>Change the "response" variable (yes/no) to binary values (1/0) for easier analysis.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <br>



        <h1>Exploratory Data Analysis </h1>
        <p>To obtain a better understanding of the dataset, the distribution of key variables and the relationships among them were plotted.</p>

        <h3>We all like making lists</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Red Apples</li>
          <li>Purple Grapes</li>
          <li>Green Kiwifruits</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Let's get crazy:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>This is a list item with two paragraphs. Lorem ipsum dolor
            sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam hendrerit
            mi posuere lectus.</p>

            <p>Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet
            vitae, risus. Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum
            sit amet velit.</p>
          </li>
          <li><p>Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.</p></li>
        </ol>

        <p>What about some code <strong>in</strong> a list? That's insane, right?</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>In Ruby you can map like this:</p>
              <code>['a', 'b'].map { |x| x.uppercase }</code>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>In Rails, you can do a shortcut:</p>
              <code>['a', 'b'].map(&amp;:uppercase)</code>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>Some people seem to like definition lists</p>

        <dl>
        <dt>Lower cost</dt>
          <dd>The new version of this product costs significantly less than the previous one!</dd>
          <dt>Easier to use</dt>
          <dd>We've changed the product so that it's much easier to use!</dd>
        </dl>

        <h3>I am a robot</h3>

        <p>Maybe you want to print <code>robot</code> to the console 1000 times. Why not?</p>
<pre>
def robot_invasion
puts("robot " * 1000)
end
</pre>

<p>How about we throw some angle braces and ampersands in there?</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class="footer"&gt;

        <h3>If you need to blame someone, the best way to do so is by quoting them:</h3>

        <blockquote>
        <p>I, at any rate, am convinced that He does not throw dice.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Or perhaps someone a little less eloquent:</p>

        <blockquote>
        <p>I wish you'd have given me this written question ahead of time so I
        could plan for it... I'm sure something will pop into my head here in
        the midst of this press conference, with all the pressure of trying to
        come up with answer, but it hadn't yet...</p>

        <p>I don't want to sound like
        I have made no mistakes. I'm confident I have. I just haven't - you
        just put me under the spot here, and maybe I'm not as quick on my feet
        as I should be in coming up with one.</p>
        </blockquote>
